# FOSSDuck 🎬

An open-source, modular video editor built with extensibility in mind.

## Overview 🚀

This project aims to develop a fully open-source, modular video editor. Currently in early development, my goal is to create a flexible and extensible platform that enables:

- Easy video editing for users
- Simple plugin development for developers
- Modular architecture for maximum flexibility

## Project Structure 🏗️

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Core**: Contains the main video processing engine, timeline management, and project management
- **Modules**: Houses various plugins for effects, transitions, import/export formats, and audio processing
- **GUI**: Manages the user interface, including the main window, timeline widget, and preview widget
- **Plugins**: Supports third-party plugin development

## Key Features ✨

### Modular Architecture
- Plugin-based system for effects, transitions, and format handling
- Clear API for plugin development
- Separation of GUI and processing logic

### Performance Considerations
- Frame caching
- GPU acceleration
- Multi-threaded rendering

## Development Roadmap 🛣️

1. Establish the basic project structure
2. Implement core video loading and saving functionality
3. Develop a basic timeline system
4. Design the plugin system architecture
5. Create a simple GUI with video preview capabilities

## Libraries and Tools 🛠️

- `moviepy` for basic video processing
- `opencv-python` for frame manipulation
- `numpy` for efficient data handling
- `PyQt6` for GUI development
- `python-ffmpeg` for video encoding/decoding
